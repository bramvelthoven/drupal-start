# Slider

This component utilizes the Swiper library to render a slider/carousel within Drupal's Single Directory Components (SDC) module. It supports passing a title and a set of items, which can include a Drupal view or other content such as images.
Usage

The Swiper Slider component can be easily implemented in your theme using a Twig inclusion. Below is an example of how to use this component in a Twig template.
Properties (Props)

    title (string): The title of the slider, displayed above the items.
    items (object): An object that can contain elements such as multiple images or a Drupal view.

## Example of implementation:

### twig

`{% include 'bram_theme:slider' with {
'title': 'Lorem ipsum',
'items': 'drupal_view('events', 'block_1')'
} only %}`

### In this example:

    The title is a string that will be displayed above the slider.
    The items are populated by the output of a Drupal view, in this case, the 'events' view with the 'block_1' display.

## Additional Information

The component is fully responsive and works across both desktop and mobile devices. It supports touch and mouse-based navigation, along with pagination and navigation arrows that are automatically generated by Swiper. You can add extra classes or CSS to further customize the appearance of the slider.
